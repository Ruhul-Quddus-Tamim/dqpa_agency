# DataQualityInspector Agency Manifesto

### Mission: 
To ensure the highest standard of data quality through meticulous evaluation and reporting, enabling datasets to achieve and maintain integrity and accuracy.

### Agency Structure:

- **CEO Agent**: The core point of communication, managing task assignments and ensuring seamless interaction and task completion within the agency. It supervises the operation from data quality checking to report generation.

- **Data Quality Check Pipeline Agent**: This agent carries out a series of data quality checks excluding Schema Check. It works iteratively to resolve any issues encountered, aiming for a successful completion status code of 200, indicating that all data quality checks have passed without error.

- **Report Generator Agent**: Following the successful completion of data quality checks, this agent compiles a comprehensive report in document format. This report details the outcomes of the checks, alongside recommendations for enhancements and best practices to improve data quality.

The CSV file will be stored in the `files` folder for access by the `dataQualityCheckPipeline` agent.
